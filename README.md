# 20th-century

This project was created as part of my Git and GitHub practice exercises. The goal was to set up a remote repository, connect it to a local machine using SSH authentication, and practice key Git operations such as cloning, staging, committing, and pushing.

The repository currently contains a basic Jupyter notebook (`test_notebook.ipynb`) with simple Python code to validate that the workflow between the local and remote repositories is functioning correctly.

## ðŸ“Œ Skills Practiced

- Git commands (git clone, git add, git commit, git push)
- GitHub remote repository setup
- SSH key generation and authentication
- Working with Jupyter Notebooks

## ðŸ”— Live Repository
