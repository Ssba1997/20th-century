Alice's Adventures in Wonderland(also known asAlice in Wonderland) is an 1865 Englishchildren's novelbyLewis Carroll, a mathematicsdonat theUniversity of Oxford. It details the story of a girl namedAlicewho falls through a rabbit hole into a fantasy world ofanthropomorphiccreatures. It is seen as an example of theliterary nonsensegenre. The artist SirJohn Tennielprovided 42 wood-engraved illustrations for the book.
It received positive reviews upon release and is now one of the best-known works ofVictorian literature; its narrative, structure, characters and imagery have had a widespread influence on popular culture and literature, especially in thefantasygenre.[1][2]It is credited as helping end an era ofdidacticisminchildren's literature, inaugurating an era in which writing for children aimed to "delight or entertain".[3]The tale plays withlogic, giving the story lasting popularity with adults as well as with children.[4]The titular character Alice shares her name withAlice Liddell, a girl Carroll knew—scholars disagree about the extent to which the character was based upon her.[5][6]
The book has never been out of print andhas been translatedinto 174 languages. Its legacy includesadaptationsto screen, radio, visual art, ballet, opera, and musical theatre, as well as theme parks, board games and video games.[7]Carroll published a sequel in 1871 entitledThrough the Looking-Glassand a shortened version for young children,The Nursery "Alice", in 1890.
Alice's Adventures in Wonderlandwas conceived on 4 July 1862, whenLewis Carrolland ReverendRobinson Duckworthrowed up the riverIsiswith the three young daughters of Carroll's friendHenry Liddell:[8][9]Lorina Charlotte (aged 13; "Prima" in the book's prefatory verse);Alice Pleasance(aged 10; "Secunda" in the verse); and Edith Mary (aged 8; "Tertia" in the verse).[10]
The journey began atFolly Bridge, Oxford, and ended 5 miles (8 km) upstream atGodstow, Oxfordshire. During the trip, Carroll told the girls a story that he described in his diary as "Alice's Adventures Under Ground", which his journal says he "undertook to write out for Alice".[11]Alice Liddell recalled that she asked Carroll to write it down: unlike other stories he had told her, this one she wanted to preserve.[12]She finally received the manuscript more than two years later.[13]
4 July was known as the "golden afternoon", prefaced in the novel as a poem.[14]In fact, the weather around Oxford on 4 July was "cool and rather wet", although at least one scholar has disputed this claim.[15]Scholars debate whether Carroll in fact came up withAliceduring the "golden afternoon" or whether the story was developed over a longer period.[14]
Carroll had known the Liddell children since around March 1856, when he befriended Harry Liddell.[16]He had met Lorina by early March as well.[17]In June 1856, he took the children out on the river.[18]Robert Douglas-Fairhurst, who wrote a literary biography of Carroll, suggests that Carroll favoured Alice Pleasance Liddell in particular because her name was ripe for allusion.[19]"Pleasance" means pleasure and the name "Alice" appeared in contemporary works, including the poem "Alice Gray" by William Mee, of which Carroll wrote a parody; Alice is a character in "Dream-Children: A Reverie", a prose piece byCharles Lamb.[19]Carroll, an amateur photographer by the late 1850s,[20]produced many photographic portraits of the Liddell children – and especially of Alice, of which 20 survive.[21]
Carroll began writing themanuscriptof the story the next day, although that earliest version is lost. The girls and Carroll took another boat trip a month later, when he elaborated the plot of the story to Alice, and in November, he began working on the manuscript in earnest.[22]To add the finishing touches, he researchednatural historyin connection with the animals presented in the book and then had the book examined by other children—particularly those ofGeorge MacDonald. Though Carroll did add his own illustrations to the original copy, on publication he was advised to find a professional illustrator so that the pictures were more appealing to his audience. He subsequently approachedJohn Tennielto reinterpret his visions through his own artistic eye, telling him that the story had been well-liked by the children.[22]
Carroll began planning a print edition of theAlicestory in 1863.[23]He wrote on 9 May 1863 that MacDonald's family had suggested he publishAlice.[13]A diary entry for 2 July says that he received a specimen page of the print edition around that date.[23]On 26 November 1864, Carroll gave Alice the manuscript ofAlice's Adventures Under Ground, with illustrations by Carroll, dedicating it as "A Christmas Gift to a Dear Child in Memory of a Summer's Day".[24][25]The published version ofAlice's Adventures in Wonderlandis about twice the length ofAlice's Adventures Under Groundand includes episodes, such as the Mad Hatter's Tea-Party (or Mad Tea Party), that do not appear in the manuscript.[26][23]The only known manuscript copy ofUnder Groundis held in theBritish Library.[23]Macmillanpublished a facsimile of the manuscript in 1886.[23]
Alice, a young girl, sits bored by a riverbank and spots aWhite Rabbitwith apocket watchandwaistcoatlamenting that he is late. Surprised, Alice follows him down a rabbit hole, which sends her into a lengthy plummet but to a safe landing. Inside a room with a table, she finds a key to a tiny door, beyond which is a garden. While pondering how to fit through the door, she discovers a bottle labelled "Drink me". Alice drinks some of the bottle's contents, and to her astonishment, she shrinks small enough to enter the door. However, she had left the key upon the table and cannot reach it. Alice then discovers and eats a cake labelled "Eat me", which causes her to grow to a tremendous size. Unhappy, Alice bursts into tears, and the passing White Rabbit flees in a panic, dropping a fan and two gloves. Alice uses the fan for herself, which causes her to shrink once more and leaves her swimming in a pool of her own tears. Within the pool, Alice meets various animals and birds, who convene on a bank and engage in a "Caucus Race" to dry themselves. Following the end of the race, Alice inadvertently frightens the animals away by discussing her cat.
The White Rabbit appears looking for the gloves and fan. Mistaking Alice for his maidservant, he orders her to go to his house and retrieve them. Alice finds another bottle and drinks from it, which causes her to grow to such an extent that she gets stuck in the house. Attempting to extract her, the White Rabbit and his neighbours eventually take to hurling pebbles that turn into small cakes. Alice eats one and shrinks herself, allowing her to flee into the forest. She meets aCaterpillarseated on a mushroom and smoking ahookah. During the Caterpillar's questioning, Alice begins to admit to her current identity crisis, compounded byher inability to remember a poem. Before crawling away, the Caterpillar says that a bite of one side of the mushroom will make her larger, while a bite from the other side will make her smaller. During a period of trial and error, Alice's neck extends between the treetops, frightening a pigeon who mistakes her for a serpent. After shrinking to an appropriate height, Alice arrives at the home of aDuchess, who owns a perpetually grinningCheshire Cat. The Duchess's baby, whom she hands to Alice, transforms into a piglet, which Alice releases into the woods. The Cheshire Cat appears to Alice and directs her toward theHatterandMarch Harebefore disappearing, leaving his grin behind. Alice finds the Hatter, March Hare, and a sleepyDormousein the midst of atea party. The Hatter explains that it is always 6 p.m. (tea time), claiming that time is standing still as punishment for the Hatter trying to "kill it". A conversation ensues around the table, and the riddle "Why is a raven like a writing desk?" is brought up. Alice impatiently decides to leave, calling the party stupid.
Noticing a door on a tree, Alice passes through and finds herself back in the room from the beginning of her journey. She takes the key and uses it to open the door to the garden, which turns out to be thecroquetcourt of theQueen of Hearts, whose guard consists of living playing cards. Alice participates in a croquet game, in which hedgehogs are used as balls, flamingos are used as mallets, and soldiers act as hoops. The Queen is short-tempered and constantly orders beheadings. When the Cheshire Cat appears as only a head, the Queen orders his beheading, only to be told that such an act is impossible. Because the cat belongs to the Duchess, Alice prompts the Queen to release the Duchess from prison to resolve the matter. When the Duchess ruminates on finding morals in everything around her, the Queen dismisses her on the threat of execution.
Alice then meets aGryphonand aMock Turtle, who dance to theLobster Quadrillewhile Alice recites (rather incorrectly)a poem. The Mock Turtle sings them "Beautiful Soup", during which the Gryphon drags Alice away for a trial, in which theKnave of Heartsstands accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The trial is conducted by theKing of Hearts, and the jury is composed of animals that Alice previously met. Alice gradually grows in size and confidence, allowing herself increasingly frequent remarks on the irrationality of the proceedings. The Queen eventually commands Alice's beheading, but Alice scoffs that the Queen's guard is only a pack of cards. Although Alice holds her own for a time, the guards soon gang up and start to swarm all over her. Alice's sister wakes her up from a dream, brushing what turns out to be leaves from Alice's face. Alice leaves her sister on the bank to imagine all the curious happenings for herself.
The main characters inAlice's Adventures in Wonderlandare the following:
InThe Annotated Alice,Martin Gardnerprovides background information for the characters. The members of the boating party that first heard Carroll's tale show up in chapter 3 ("A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale"). Alice Liddell is there, while Carroll is caricatured as the Dodo (Lewis Carroll was apen namefor Charles Lutwidge Dodgson; because he stuttered when he spoke, he sometimes pronounced his last name as "Dodo-Dodgson"). The Duck refers toRobinson Duckworth, and the Lory and Eaglet to Alice Liddell's sisters Lorina and Edith.[27]
Bill the Lizard may be a play on the name of British Prime MinisterBenjamin Disraeli.[28]One of Tenniel's illustrations inThrough the Looking-Glass— the 1871 sequel toAlice— depicts the character referred to as the "Man in White Paper" (whom Alice meets on a train) as a caricature of Disraeli, wearing a paper hat.[29]The illustrations of the Lion and the Unicorn (also inLooking-Glass) look like Tenniel'sPunchillustrations ofWilliam Ewart Gladstoneand Disraeli, although Gardner says there is "no proof" that they were intended to represent these politicians.[30]
Gardner has suggested that the Hatter is a reference toTheophilus Carter, an Oxford furniture dealer, and that Tenniel apparently drew the Hatter to resemble Carter, on a suggestion of Carroll's.[31]The Dormouse tells a story about three little sisters named Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie. These are the Liddell sisters: Elsie is L.C. (Lorina Charlotte); Tillie is Edith (her family nickname is Matilda); and Lacie is ananagramof Alice.[32]
The Mock Turtle speaks of a drawling-master, "an oldcongereel", who came once a week to teach "Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils". This is a reference to the art criticJohn Ruskin, who came once a week to the Liddell house to teach the children to draw, sketch, and paint in oils.[33][34]The Mock Turtle sings "Turtle Soup", which is a parody of a song called "Star of the Evening, Beautiful Star", which the Liddells sang for Carroll.[35][36]
Carroll wrote multiple poems and songs forAlice's Adventures in Wonderland, including:
Carroll's biographerMorton N. CohenreadsAliceas aroman à clefpopulated with real figures from Carroll's life. Alice is based on Alice Liddell; the Dodo is Carroll; Wonderland is Oxford; even the Mad Hatter's Tea Party, according to Cohen, is a send-up of Alice's own birthday party.[5]The critic Jan Susina rejects Cohen's account, arguing that Alice the character bears a tenuous relationship with Alice Liddell.[6]
Beyond its refashioning of Carroll's everyday life, Cohen argues,Alicecritiques Victorian ideals of childhood. It is an account of "the child's plight in Victorian upper-class society", in which Alice's mistreatment by the creatures of Wonderland reflects Carroll's own mistreatment by older people as a child.[43]
In the eighth chapter, three cards are painting the roses on a rose tree red, because they had accidentally planted a white-rose tree that the Queen of Hearts hates. According toWilfrid Scott-Giles, the rose motif inAlicealludes to the EnglishWars of the Roses: red roses symbolised theHouse of Lancaster, and white roses the rivalHouse of York.[44]
Aliceis full of linguistic play, puns, and parodies.[45]According toGillian Beer, Carroll's play with language evokes the feeling of words for new readers: they "still have insecure edges and a nimbus of nonsense blurs the sharp focus of terms".[46]The literary scholar Jessica Straley, in a work about the role of evolutionary theory in Victorian children's literature, argues that Carroll's focus on language prioritises humanism overscientismby emphasising language's role in human self-conception.[47]
Pat's "Digging for apples" is across-language pun, aspomme de terre(literally; "apple of the earth") means potato andpommemeans apple.[48]In the second chapter, Alice initially addresses the mouse as "O Mouse", based on her memory of the noundeclensions"in her brother'sLatin Grammar, 'A mouse – of a mouse – to a mouse – a mouse – O mouse!'" These words correspond to the first five of Latin's six cases, in a traditional order established by medieval grammarians:mus(nominative),muris(genitive),muri(dative),murem(accusative),(O) mus(vocative). The sixth case,mure(ablative) is absent from Alice's recitation. Nilson suggests that Alice's missing ablative is a pun on her father Henry Liddell's work on the standardA Greek-English Lexicon, since ancient Greek does not have an ablative case. Further, mousa (μούσα, meaningmuse) was a standard model noun in Greek textbooks of the time in paradigms of the first declension, short-alpha noun.[49]
Mathematics and logic are central toAlice.[50]As Carroll was a mathematician at Christ Church, it has been suggested that there are many references and mathematical concepts in both this story andThrough the Looking-Glass.[51][52]Literary scholar Melanie Bayley asserts in theNew Scientistmagazine that Carroll wroteAlice in Wonderlandin its final form as a satire on mid-19th century mathematics.[53]
Carina Garlandnotes how the world is "expressed via representations of food and appetite", naming Alice's frequent desire for consumption (of both food and words), her 'Curious Appetites'.[54]Often, the idea of eating coincides to make gruesome images. After the riddle "Why is a raven like a writing-desk?", the Hatter claims that Alice might as well say, "I see what I eat…I eat what I see" and so the riddle's solution, put forward by Boe Birns, could be that "A raven eats worms; a writing desk is worm-eaten"; this idea of food encapsulates idea of life feeding on life itself, for the worm is being eaten and then becomes the eater—a horrific image of mortality.[55]
Nina Auerbach discusses how the novel revolves around eating and drinking which "motivates much of her [Alice's] behaviour", for the story is essentially about things "entering and leaving her mouth."[56]The animals of Wonderland are of particular interest, for Alice's relation to them shifts constantly because, as Lovell-Smith states, Alice's changes in size continually reposition her in the food chain, serving as a way to make her acutely aware of the 'eat or be eaten' attitude that permeates Wonderland.[57]
Aliceis an example of theliterary nonsensegenre.[58]According toHumphrey Carpenter,Alice'sbrand of nonsense embraces thenihilisticandexistential. Characters in nonsensical episodes such as the Mad Hatter's Tea Party, in which it is always the same time, go on posing paradoxes that are never resolved.[59]
Wonderland is a rule-bound world, but its rules are not those of our world. The literary scholar Daniel Bivona writes thatAliceis characterised by "gamelike social structures."[60]She trusts in instructions from the beginning, drinking from the bottle labelled "drink me" after recalling, during her descent, that children who do not follow the rules often meet terrible fates.[61]Unlike the creatures of Wonderland, who approach their world's wonders uncritically, Alice continues to look for rules as the story progresses.Gillian Beersuggests that Alice looks for rules to soothe her anxiety, while Carroll may have hunted for rules because he struggled with the implications of thenon-Euclidean geometrythen in development.[62]
The manuscript was illustrated by Carroll, who added 37 illustrations—printed in afacsimileedition in 1887.[24]John Tenniel provided 42wood-engravedillustrations for the published version of the book.[63]The first print run was destroyed (or sold in the US)[64]at Carroll's request because Tenniel was dissatisfied with the printing quality. There are only 22 known first edition copies in existence.[63]The book was reprinted and published in 1866.[24]Tenniel's detailed black-and-white drawings remain the definitive depiction of the characters.[65]
Tenniel's illustrations of Alice do not portray the real Alice Liddell,[6]who had dark hair and a short fringe.Alicehas provided a challenge for other illustrators, including those of 1907 byCharles Pearsand the full series of colour plates and line-drawings byHarry Rountreepublished in the (inter-War) Children's Press (Glasgow) edition. Other significant illustrators include:Arthur Rackham(1907),Willy Pogany(1929),Mervyn Peake(1946),Ralph Steadman(1967),Salvador Dalí(1969),Graham Overden(1969),Max Ernst(1970),Peter Blake(1970),Tove Jansson(1977),Anthony Browne(1988),Helen Oxenbury(1999),[66]andLisbeth Zwerger(1999).
Carroll first metAlexander Macmillan, a high-powered London publisher, on 19 October 1863.[13]His firm,Macmillan Publishers, agreed to publishAlice's Adventures in Wonderlandby sometime in 1864.[67]Carroll financed the initial print run, possibly because it gave him more editorial authority than other financing methods.[67]He managed publication details such astypesettingand engaged illustrators and translators.[68]
Macmillan had publishedThe Water-Babies, also a children's fantasy, in 1863, and suggested its design as a basis forAlice's.[69]Carroll saw a specimen copy in May 1865.[70]2,000 copies were printed by July, but Tenniel objected to their quality, and Carroll instructed Macmillan to halt publication so they could be reprinted.[24][71]In August, he engaged Richard Clay as an alternative printer for a new run of 2,000.[72]The reprint cost £600, paid entirely by Carroll.[73]He received the first copy of Clay's edition on 9 November 1865.[73]
Macmillan finally published the new edition, printed by Richard Clay, in November 1865.[2][74]Carroll requested a red binding, deeming it appealing to young readers.[75][76]A new edition, released in December 1865 for the Christmas market but carrying an 1866 date, was quickly printed.[77][78]The text blocks of the original edition were removed from the binding and sold with Carroll's permission to the New York publishing house ofD. Appleton & Company.[79]The binding for the AppletonAlicewas identical to the 1866 MacmillanAlice, except for the publisher's name at the foot of thespine. The title page of the AppletonAlicewas an insert cancelling the original Macmillan title page of 1865 and bearing the New York publisher's imprint and the date 1866.[2]
The entire print run sold out quickly.Alicewas a publishing sensation, beloved by children and adults alike.[2]Oscar Wildewas a fan;[80]Queen Victoriawas also an avid reader of the book.[81]She reportedly enjoyedAliceenough that she asked for Carroll's next book, which turned out to be a mathematical treatise; Carroll denied this.[82]The book has never been out of print.[2]Alice's Adventures in Wonderlandhas been translated into 174 languages.[83]
The following list is a timeline of major publication events related toAlice's Adventures in Wonderland:
Alicewas published to critical praise.[100]One magazine declared it "exquisitely wild, fantastic, [and] impossible".[101]In the late 19th century,Walter Besantwrote thatAlice in Wonderland"was a book of that extremely rare kind which will belong to all the generations to come until the language becomes obsolete".[102]
No story in English literature has intrigued me more than Lewis Carroll'sAlice in Wonderland. It fascinated me the first time I read it as a schoolboy.
F. J. Harvey Dartonargued in a 1932 book thatAliceended an era ofdidacticisminchildren's literature, inaugurating a new era in which writing for children aimed to "delight or entertain".[3]In 2014,Robert McCrumnamedAlice"one of the best loved in the English canon" and called it "perhaps the greatest, possibly most influential, and certainly the most world-famous Victorian English fiction".[2]A 2020 review inTimestates: "The book changed young people's literature. It helped to replace stiff Victorian didacticism with a looser, sillier, nonsense style that reverberated through the works of language-loving 20th-century authors as different asJames Joyce,Douglas AdamsandDr. Seuss."[1]The protagonist of the story, Alice, has been recognised as acultural icon.[104]In 2006,Alice in Wonderlandwas named among the icons of England in a public vote.[105]
Books for children in theAlicemould emerged as early as 1869 and continued to appear throughout the late 19th century.[107]Released in 1903, the British silent filmAlice in Wonderlandwas the first screen adaptation of the book.[108]
In 2015,Robert Douglas-Fairhurstwrote in theGuardian,
Since the first publication ofAlice's Adventures in Wonderland150 years ago, Lewis Carroll's work has spawned a whole industry, from films and theme park rides to products such as a "cute and sassy" Alice costume ("petticoat and stockings not included"). The blank-faced little girl made famous by John Tenniel's original illustrations has become a cultural inkblot we can interpret in any way we like.[7]
Labelled "a dauntless, no-nonsense heroine" by theGuardian, the character of the plucky, yet proper, Alice has proven immensely popular and inspired similar heroines in literature and pop culture, many also named Alice in homage.[109]The book has inspired numerous film and television adaptations, which have multiplied, as the original work is now in the public domain in all jurisdictions. Musical works inspired byAliceincludethe Beatles's song "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", with songwriterJohn Lennonattributing the song's fantastical imagery to his reading of Carroll's books.[110]A popular figure in Japan sincethe country opened up to the Westin the late 19th century, Alice has been a popular subject for writers ofmangaand a source of inspiration for Japanese fashion, in particularLolita fashion.[111][112]
The first full major production wasAlice in Wonderland, amusical playin London'sWest EndbyHenry Savile ClarkeandWalter Slaughter, which premiered at thePrince of Wales Theatrein 1886. Twelve-year-old actressPhoebe Carlo(the first to play Alice) was personally selected by Carroll for the role.[113]Carroll attended a performance on 30 December 1886, writing in his diary that he enjoyed it.[114]The musical was frequently revived during West End Christmas seasons during the four decades after its premiere, including a London production at theGlobe Theatrein 1888, withIsa Bowmanas Alice.[115][116]
As the book and its sequel are Carroll's most widely recognised works, they have also inspired numerous live performances, including plays, operas, ballets, and traditional Englishpantomimes. These works range from fairly faithful adaptations to those that use the story as a basis for new works.Eva Le Gallienne's stage adaptation of theAlicebooks premiered on 12 December 1932 and ended its run in May 1933.[117]The production was revived in New York in 1947 and 1982. A community theatre production ofAlicewasOlivia de Havilland's first foray onto the stage.[118]
A dramatisation byHerbert M. Prenticepremiered at theShakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon in 1947, and was in turn adapted for television byJohn Glyn-Jonesand shown by the BBC on Christmas Day 1948.[119]The BBC screened another adaptation of Prentice's play in 1956.[120]
Joseph PappstagedAlice in Concertat thePublic Theaterin New York City in 1980.Elizabeth Swadoswrote the book, lyrics, and music based on bothAlice's Adventures in WonderlandandThrough the Looking-Glass. Papp and Swados had previously produced a version of it at theNew York Shakespeare Festival.Meryl Streepplayed Alice, the White Queen, and Humpty Dumpty.[121]The cast also includedDebbie Allen,Michael Jeter, andMark Linn-Baker. Performed on a bare stage with the actors in modern dress, the play is a loose adaptation, with song styles ranging the globe.
The 1992 musical theatre productionAliceused both books as its inspiration. It also employs scenes with Carroll, a young Alice Liddell, and an adult Alice Liddell, to frame the story. Paul Schmidt wrote the play, withTom WaitsandKathleen Brennanwriting the music.[122][123]Although the original production inHamburg, Germany, received only a small audience, Tom Waits released the songs as the albumAlicein 2002.[124]
The English composerJoseph Horovitzcomposed anAlice in Wonderlandballet commissioned by theLondon Festival Balletin 1953. It was performed frequently in England and the US.[125]A ballet byChristopher WheeldonandNicholas Wrightcommissioned for theRoyal BalletentitledAlice's Adventures in Wonderlandpremiered in February 2011 at theRoyal Opera Housein London.[126][127]The ballet was based on the novel Wheeldon grew up reading as a child and is generally faithful to the original story, although some critics claimed it may have been too faithful.[128]
Unsuk Chin's operaAlice in Wonderlandpremiered in 2007 at theBavarian State Opera[129]and was hailed as World Premiere of the Year by the German opera magazineOpernwelt.[130]Gerald Barry's 2016 one-actopera,Alice's Adventures Under Ground, first staged in 2020 at the Royal Opera House, is a conflation of the twoAlicebooks.[131]In 2022, theOpéra national du Rhinperformed the balletAlice, with a score byPhilip Glass, inMulhouse, France.[132]
Characters from the book are depicted in the stained glass windows of Carroll's hometown church,All Saints', inDaresbury, Cheshire, England.[133]Another commemoration of Carroll's work in his home county of Cheshire is the granite sculptureThe Mad Hatter's Tea Party, located in Warrington.[134]International works based on the book include the Alice in Wonderland statue inCentral Park, New York, and the Alice statue inRymill Park,Adelaide, Australia.[135][136]
In 2015,Alicecharacters were featured on aseries of UK postage stampsissued by theRoyal Mailto mark the 150th anniversary of the publication of the book.[137]In 2021, theRoyal Mintissued their firstAlice's Adventures in Wonderlandcommemorative coin collection, including a£5 coinfeaturing Alice and the Cheshire Cat (inspired by Tenniel's original illustration).[138]
